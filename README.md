# 📖 [A web Application platform that connect Recruiters and Students/Graduates in Universities in Ghana] <a name="about-project"></a>
The system will allow users to create their accounts and log in. Actions to be performed will depend on the type of user. Student and Graduates will be able to create their accounts. Once the admin approves them before being published, they will be notified and log in. Once they log in, they can review their profile, edit some information. When the recruiter contacts them, they will be able to see it from the system as well as the email. Recruiters will also create their accounts, log in and go through the system interfaces on the platform to get the student or graduate who meet the eligibility criteria for the position.

## 🔭 Future Work <a name="future-features"></a>

One main feature we are planning to explore is including more universities in such a way that
different universities will be able to use the platform. Each university will have its specific
interface, and it will be customized based on what they need.
Adding to that, the integration of a live chatbot will also be helpful, given that it will assist our
users in a short time.
Finally, we will consider developing a mobile application to improve user experience. The system
is now mainly accessed via the web browser of devices.
